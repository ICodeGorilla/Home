# Floating Versions in the Package Manager UI

* Status: In Review
* Author(s): [Martin Ruiz](https://github.com/martinrrm)
* Issue: [3788](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/3788) PackageReference with a star in version is displayed under the updates tab/incorrectly represented in the installed tab

## Problem Background

Currently the user can specify a version range or a floating version, but the current behavior of the package manager UI has poor support for this, displaying an incorrect installed version. If the user indicates a floating version in any package (eg `5.*`) the PM UI will display the minimum version possible (`5.0.0`) as installed even though the resolved version could be different of the resolved version in the command `dotnet list package`. Furthermore the user cannot specify a version range free hand.

### Current behavior

### Updates Tab

With the current behavior even if the user indicated a floating version, such as `*`, for the package version, the UI will tell the user that there is an update available which is misleading.

```
The requested and installed versions are not correct because dotnet list package shows a different installed version.
```

## Who are the customers

All customers that use the Package Manager UI to install or update packages.

## Goals

* Allow users see the correct version of the package installed while using floating versions in the Package Manager UI in Project View.

* Allow users to input floating versions to install in the Package Manager UI.

* Allow users to distinguish between requested and resolved package versions in the Solution View.

## Non-Goals

* Any multi targeting improvements overall.

## Solution

### Installed Tab

Display the correct resolved version of each package in this tab will correct the displayed version in this tab and avoid the package being listed in the `Updates Tab`.

### Floating Version Display in Project View

When searching for a package in the `Browse Tab` or `Installed Tab` the user is not able to select a floating or range version to install. We will implement a `Combo Box` that will autocomplete the available version of the package with the user input.

This feature will enable the option `*` and ranges to be selected while installing/updating a package. Also enables scenarios beyond floating version and improves the UX.

### Floating Version Display in Solution View

We will add a new column to show the requested version to match the behavior of `dotnet list package` command. Show correct highest resolved version in the solution in the package list view.

## Future Work

* Indicate the resolved version in the solution explorer.

## Open Questions

Should we show available updates for packages that use custom version ranges or floating versions that donâ€™t resolve to the latest version?

### Example

## Considerations

Should we allow people to install package versions within a custom range without overwriting the project file?

We will not allow users to install package versions within a custom range without overwriting the project file. The project file version is a statement of intent and the version resolved should be resolved the same regardless whether you are installing it through the Package Manager UI, the command line or hand editing.
